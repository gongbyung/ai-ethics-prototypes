**Structured Analysis Using the Belmont Report Principles**

### 1. Respect for Persons
The principle of respect for persons emphasizes the importance of autonomy, consent, and dignity. In the context of mortgage approval systems, it is vital to recognize that applicants are individuals with unique circumstances and rights. 

- **Autonomy and Informed Consent**: The use of automated decision systems must be transparent. Borrowers should be informed about how their data is used, what factors influence their approval, and the implications of the decision. The exclusion of certain variables (like denial reasons) could hinder applicants' understanding of the decision-making process.
  
- **Dignity**: The disparate approval rates across racial groups raise concerns about dignity. For instance, the approval rate for Black or African American applicants is notably lower (0.649 in XGBoost) compared to White applicants (0.876). This disparity suggests a systemic bias that undermines the dignity of affected individuals, treating them as less deserving of equitable access to financial resources.

### 2. Beneficence
The principle of beneficence focuses on maximizing benefits and minimizing harm. 

- **Maximizing Benefits**: The model's performance (ROC-AUC of 0.795 for XGBoost) indicates a reasonable ability to identify creditworthy borrowers. However, this benefit is not uniformly distributed. The approval rates and disparate impact ratios suggest that marginalized groups are not receiving equitable access to mortgage approvals, which can perpetuate cycles of disadvantage.

- **Minimizing Harm**: The error rates indicate a concerning trend, especially for Black or African American applicants, who have a false negative rate (FNR) of 0.296 in XGBoost. This means they are more likely to be incorrectly denied loans, which can lead to significant financial harm and exacerbate existing inequalities. Additionally, the high false positive rates (FPR) for many groups indicate that even when loans are approved, they may not be in the best interest of all borrowers.

### 3. Justice
The principle of justice requires fair distribution of risks and rewards. 

- **Equitable Access**: The data reveals significant disparities in approval rates and disparate impact ratios among racial groups. For example, the Black or African American group has a disparate impact ratio of 0.741 compared to White applicants. This suggests that systemic barriers may be at play, which could be linked to historical inequities in access to financial resources.

- **Distribution of Risks**: The high FNR and FPR for marginalized groups indicate that they bear a disproportionate share of the risks associated with these automated systems. This raises ethical concerns about how risk is assessed and the potential for reinforcing existing societal biases.

### System 1 (Fast Detector) and System 2 (Slow Adjudicator) Reasoning

- **System 1 (Fast Detector)**: This system operates on intuition and heuristics, often leading to quick judgments based on available data. The model's reliance on features like income ratio and DTI may inadvertently reinforce biases if these features correlate with historical inequities. For example, if certain racial groups are historically underrepresented in higher income brackets, the model may quickly categorize them as higher risk, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage.

- **System 2 (Slow Adjudicator)**: This system engages in more deliberate and reflective thinking. It is essential for decision-makers to scrutinize the model's outputs, considering the broader social context and potential systemic causes of observed disparities. Governance implications include the need for regular audits of the model to ensure fairness, transparency, and accountability. Stakeholders should engage in ongoing dialogue with affected communities to understand their experiences and perspectives, ensuring that the model evolves to better serve all applicants.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, while the automated decision systems show promise in identifying creditworthy borrowers, the ethical implications of their deployment must be carefully considered. Addressing the disparities in approval rates, error rates, and the potential for systemic bias is essential to uphold the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. Governance frameworks should be established to ensure that these systems are regularly evaluated and adjusted to promote fairness and equity in mortgage lending.

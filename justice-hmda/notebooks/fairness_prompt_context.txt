Model setup:
- Target: approved (1 = approved, 0 = denied)
- Data: 2022 California HMDA (265k clean loans)
- Train/test split: 70/30, stratified by approval outcome
- Excluded leakage variables: interest_rate, rate_spread, denial_reason_*, purchaser_*, hoepa_status, etc.

Key features:
- income_ratio: borrower income relative to loan size
- loan_to_value_ratio: how leveraged the borrower is
- dti_clean: debt-to-income ratio
- loan_term, occupancy_type, property_value, total_units
- co_applicant_* demographic fields
- race_group_* indicators (White as baseline)

Top features (XGBoost importance):
dti_clean, income_ratio, loan_to_value_ratio, co_applicant_race_observed



Context:
Research by William Apgar et al. (Harvard JCHS, 2007) found that the mortgage market is segmented,
with African-American and Hispanic borrowers more likely to receive loans through less-regulated,
higher-priced channels â€” often outside CRA oversight. These structural patterns may contribute to
observed approval and pricing disparities, even when controlling for credit risk factors.



Model Performance:
- Logistic Regression ROC-AUC: 0.740
- XGBoost ROC-AUC: 0.795


Here are fairness metrics from two mortgage approval models (Logistic Regression and XGBoost):

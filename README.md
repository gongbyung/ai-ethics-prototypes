# AI Ethics Prototypes: Walking the Walk

> *Start small. Think big. Stay human.*

This repository contains a collection of prototypes exploring how ethical guardrails can be applied to real-world data systems.  
The focus is on moving from abstract principles to working experiments that can be tested, broken, and improved.

These projects are inspired by:  
- **The Belmont Report** (Respect, Beneficence, Justice as timeless ethical duties)  
- **Immanuel Kant** (deontological guardrails that resist bending)  
- **Daniel Kahneman** (*Thinking Fast and Slow*: System 1 intuition vs. System 2 deliberation)  

The long-term vision is to build toward an **AI Ethics Officer** — an independent "agent of agents" that combines fast anomaly detection (System 1) with slower, principled reasoning (System 2) to provide assurance around AI systems.

## Prototypes

### 1. Justice: HMDA Disparate Impact Detector
- **Goal:** Identify potential disparate impacts in mortgage lending using Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data.  
- **Method:** Apply fairness metrics (disparate impact ratio, approval rate comparisons) across demographic groups.  
- **Analogy:** A **fairness smoke detector** — it beeps when outcomes drift, so you can check before the house burns down.  

### 2. Respect: CFPB Complaint NLP Pipeline
- **Goal:** Extract themes and hot spots from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint database.  
- **Method:** Natural language processing (clustering, topic modeling, sentiment).  
- **Analogy:** Like scrolling Yelp reviews — except instead of picking lunch, you’re spotting institutions giving people financial food poisoning.  

### 3. Beneficence: Anomaly Detection in Core Banking Systems
- **Goal:** Detect unusual spikes or errors in bank core system logs that may signal fraud or systemic failures.  
- **Method:** Time-series anomaly detection (e.g., X-MR charts, rolling variance).  
- **Analogy:** The tattletale dashboard light that warns you before something escalates into a bigger problem.

## Why This Matters

AI oversight will fail if it only reacts fast without thinking, or thinks deeply without acting fast.
These prototypes are attempts to walk the walk — starting with concrete experiments in banking, consumer protection, and risk management.

They’re not perfect. They’re minimum viable prototypes.
The goal is to start small, think big, and stay human.

If you want to contribute — poke holes, suggest metrics, or add your own prototype — join in.
Let’s test, break, and improve together.

# AI Ethics Prototypes: Walking the Walk

**Start small. Think big. Stay human.**

This repository contains a collection of prototypes exploring how ethical guardrails can be applied to real-world data systems.  
The focus is on moving from abstract principles to working experiments that can be tested, broken, and improved.

## 🎯 Inspiration
- **The Belmont Report** — Respect, Beneficence, Justice as timeless ethical duties  
- **Immanuel Kant** — Deontological guardrails that resist bending  
- **Daniel Kahneman** — *Thinking Fast and Slow*: System 1 intuition vs. System 2 deliberation  

The long-term vision is to build toward an **AI Ethics Officer** — an independent "agent of agents" that combines fast anomaly detection (System 1) with slower, principled reasoning (System 2) to provide assurance around AI systems.

## 🧪 Prototypes

| Prototype | Goal | Method | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|--------|
| **Justice: HMDA Disparate Impact Detector** | Identify potential disparate impacts in mortgage lending | EDA + baseline stats (Logit/OLS) → ML trade-offs (RF/XGB) | 🚧 MVP in progress |
| **Respect: CFPB Complaint NLP Pipeline** | Extract themes & hot spots from CFPB complaints | NLP (clustering, topic modeling, sentiment) | 🚧 MVP in progress |
| **Beneficence: Core Banking Anomaly Detection** | Detect unusual spikes/errors in bank system logs | Time-series anomaly detection (X-MR charts, rolling variance) | 🚧 MVP in progress |

👉 Each prototype lives in its own sub-folder with a dedicated README and code.

## 💡 Why This Matters
AI oversight will fail if it only reacts fast without thinking, or thinks deeply without acting fast.  
These prototypes are attempts to **walk the walk** — starting with concrete experiments in banking, consumer protection, and risk management.

They’re not perfect. They’re minimum viable prototypes.  
The goal is simple: **start small, think big, and stay human.**

 # AI Ethics Prototypes: Walking the Walk

**Start small. Think big. Stay human.**

This repository hosts a collection of prototypes exploring how ethical guardrails can be embedded into real-world data and decision systems.  
Each prototype moves from abstract principle → applied experiment → measurable outcome — so ethics isn’t just discussed, it’s built and tested.

---

## Inspiration
- **The Belmont Report** — Respect, Beneficence, Justice as timeless ethical duties  
- **Immanuel Kant** — Deontological guardrails that resist bending  
- **Daniel Kahneman** — *Thinking Fast and Slow*: System 1 intuition vs. System 2 deliberation  

The long-term vision is to build toward an **AI Ethics Officer** — an independent “agent of agents” that combines fast anomaly detection (System 1) with slower, principled reasoning (System 2) to provide assurance around AI systems.

## Prototypes

| Prototype | Ethical Principle | Question We’re Trying to Answer | Goal | Method | Status |
|-----------|------------------|----------------------------------|------|--------|--------|
| **Justice: HMDA Disparate Impact Detector** | Justice (Fairness) | *Are lending outcomes equitable across demographic groups?* | Identify potential disparate impacts in mortgage lending | EDA → Logistic regression → ML fairness tests (RF/XGB) | MVP Completed |
| **Respect: CFPB Complaint NLP Pipeline** | Respect for Persons (Voice & Transparency) | *What are people telling us when they say something feels unfair or manipulative?* | Extract themes and ethical “hot spots” from consumer complaints | NLP (topic modeling, clustering, sentiment) | MVP in progress |
| **Beneficence: Who Pays More? Rate Spread & Lifetime Harm Estimator** | Beneficence (Do Good, Avoid Harm) | *Even when lending is “fair,” who ultimately benefits — and who bears the long-term cost?* | Quantify borrower harm or benefit via lifetime cost deltas from rate spreads | HMDA + APOR analysis → cost simulation → fairness-aware explainability (SHAP) | MVP in progress |

## System 2 MVP: Turning Signals into Reasoning

System 1 models flag ethical signals — fairness gaps, manipulative design, or potential harm — but signals alone don’t create accountability.  
The **System 2 MVP** adds deliberation by routing these System 1 outputs into a reasoning layer powered by an LLM.

### Concept
- **Input:** Structured alerts from System 1 prototypes (e.g., HMDA disparity, complaint cluster, rate-spread harm).  
- **Process:** The LLM applies ethical reasoning prompts based on **Belmont principles** — Respect, Beneficence, Justice — to explain:  
  - *Which principle is implicated?*  
  - *Is this risk acceptable or systemic?*  
  - *What actions mitigate or justify it?*  
- **Output:** A short, human-readable rationale and severity tag (e.g., “Moderate risk to Respect — coercive consent likely; fix onboarding flow.”)

### Example Flow
1. **System 1 Alert:** “Rate-spread gap = 0.45 pp for Black borrowers after controls.”  
2. **System 2 Prompt:**  
   > “Act as an AI Ethics Officer applying the Belmont principles. Evaluate this alert. Identify which duties are affected, whether the risk is acceptable or unacceptable, and recommend mitigations.”  
3. **System 2 Response:**  
   > “Justice principle violated — persistent disparity likely. Beneficence is partially offset by inclusion benefits. Recommend fairness audit and rate-cap review.”

## Why This Matters

AI oversight will fail if it only reacts fast without thinking, or thinks deeply without acting fast.  
These prototypes are early steps toward **walking the walk** — testing whether ethical duties can be operationalized in real data systems across fairness, respect, and welfare.

They’re not perfect. They’re minimum viable prototypes.  
The goal is simple: **start small, think big, and stay human.**

  "methodology": "Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) regression trained on approved conventional loans from the 2022 HMDA California dataset. The model predicts 'rate_spread'\u2014the difference between the loan rate and a benchmark\u2014using borrower credit-relevant variables only: loan amount, loan term, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), income ratio, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Process-level and institutional factors (such as AUS access, submission channel, lender size, and pricing features) are intentionally excluded to focus on borrower-level credit characteristics. Race group dummies are used to estimate conditional pricing disparities relative to White borrowers (reference group). Negative average effects imply lower predicted rates; positive effects imply higher predicted rates, all else equal.",

  "notes": "All numeric features were used as-is with median imputation where necessary. Categorical race variables were one-hot encoded. Only credit-related features were included to minimize proxy bias. Counterfactual simulations show minimal race-based predictive differences (<0.04 percentage points), suggesting limited influence of race on modeled mortgage pricing after accounting for legitimate credit factors. Results indicate a high degree of procedural fairness and minimal residual disparity."

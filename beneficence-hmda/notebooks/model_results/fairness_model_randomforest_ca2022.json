  "objective": "Estimate conditional differences in predicted mortgage rate spreads by race using a nonlinear, tree-based model controlling only for credit-relevant features.",
  "methodology": "Random Forest regression trained on approved conventional loans from the 2022 HMDA California dataset. The model predicts 'rate_spread'\u2014the difference between the loan rate and a benchmark\u2014using borrower credit-relevant variables only: loan amount, loan term, loan-to-value ratio (LTV), income ratio, and debt-to-income ratio (DTI). No process or institutional factors (such as AUS access, submission channel, lender size, or pricing components) are included, ensuring that the model isolates disparities linked solely to borrower credit profiles. Race group dummies are incorporated to estimate conditional pricing differences relative to White borrowers (reference group). Negative effects indicate lower predicted rates; positive effects indicate higher predicted rates, holding credit characteristics constant.",
